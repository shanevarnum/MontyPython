### Hey there! This repo is dedicated to harnassing big data tools like Hadoop and PySpark..and some other projects too

The first item in the pipeline is The Big Data Energy Project. Essentially the roadmap looks a little like this:

* Create VM for project using Linux
* Install single node Hadoop cluster
* Determine data architecture and flow
* Install PySpark components and prepare environment
* Build ETL setup and deployment environment 
* Determine data sources
* Create ML model (something simple lets just predict somethin')
* Store the new data and analyze/visualize it

Simple, right?

Theres going to be other stuff here too but for now this is what I've got lined up
